# David's Fanaro Custom Home Page

Built with react and tailwind

- [x] Layout
- [x] Services
- [ ] Search Engine Compenents
- [ ] Better Background
- [ ] Docker
- [ ] Weather Compenent
- [ ] Style Overhaul (Maybe)

Icons are mostly from react-icons

Plus I know react is maybe a bit overkill but its what I'm used too.
